Farabi6
=======

This is a fun Perl 6 port of the Farabi Modern Perl Editor:
http://metacpan.org/module/Farabi

The idea here is to experiment with a Perl 6 in-browser editor running over Rakudo Perl 6. 

Please Note that this project is highly **experimental** and may explode in your face. You have been warned :)

Have fun!

## Installation

To run it from the local directory:

    bin/farabi6
    # Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

To install it using Panda:

    panda install Farabi6
    farabi6
    # Open http://localhost:3030 in your browser

## Running

Run the following command after installing using Panda

    farabi6
