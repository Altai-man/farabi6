=======

This is a fun port of the Farabi Modern Perl Editor from CPAN, http://metacpan.org/modules/Farabi

The idea here is to experiment with a Perl 6 in-browser editor over rakudo Perl 6. 

Note: this project is highly experimental and may explode in your face. You have been warned :)

Have fun!
